# Specification Training Materials

Training materials about developing and applying data specifications. We use ontologies for a lot of examples but people shouldn't be limited to using them, though the principles should be reused. 

Considerations
- What is a specification?
- Starting Resources
- Data need assessment
- Data descriptions (which is a whole lesson/module in it's own)
- Going from data descriptions to tabular data
- Forming your fields, which are infromed by the fields
  - need to have this understanding before you can map against and consider against existing standards. 
- Standardize your terms (based on 10 simple rules paper)
  - Many of which should be broken into sublessons as individual rules cover several concepts.

For reference, 10 simple rules for standarizing your terms:
_note: a lot if not all of these rules also apply to developing fields. So perhaps the rules need to be simplified to be more reusable across both field and term components, and then narrower examples are provided for the hands-on cases for fields and terms.

- Rule 1: Reuse Existing Terms
- Rule 2: Keep Concepts Simple & Specific
- Rule 3: Use Technical (not Colloquial) Words
- Rule 4: Keep Terms as Universal as Possible
- Rule 5: Avoid Abbreviations
- Rule 6: Use IRIs
- Rule 7: Provide Definitions
- Rule 8: Update and Deprecate
- Rule 9: Use Tags to Avoid Ambiguity
- Rule 10: Use Well-Maintained Ontologies

Also have the FSCI course, which focuses on ontologizing picklists but has good hands on examples.
