# Specification Training Materials

Training materials about developing and applying data specifications


Considerations
- What is a specification?
- Starting Resources
- Data need assessment
- Data descriptions (which is a whole lesson/module in it's own)
- Going from data descriptions to tabular data
- Forming your fields, which are infromed by the fields
  - need to have this understanding before you can map against and consider against existing standards. 
- Standardize your terms (based on 10 simple rules paper)
  - Many of which should be broken into sublessons as individual rules cover several concepts.

For reference, 10 simple rules for standarizing your terms:
_note: a lot if not all of these rules also apply to developing fields. So perhaps the rules need to be simplified to be more reusable across both field and term components, and then narrower examples are provided for the hands-on cases for fields and terms.

Rule 1: Reuse Existing Terms
Rule 2: Keep Concepts Simple & Specific
Rule 3: Use Technical (not Colloquial) Words
Rule 4: Keep Terms as Universal as Possible
Rule 5: Avoid Abbreviations
Rule 6: Use IRIs
Rule 7: Provide Definitions
Rule 8: Update and Deprecate
Rule 9: Use Tags to Avoid Ambiguity
Rule 10: Use Well-Maintained Ontologies
